### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* judge_coding_plan now requires research_urls parameter

Benefits:
- ✅ Forces AI assistants to do actual online research
- ✅ Validates research quality through URL evidence
- ✅ Ensures investigation of existing solutions and best practices
- ✅ Improves implementation approach validation
- ✅ All tests updated and passing (41/41)

* feat: mandate online research with URL validation and backward compatibility

- Make online research MANDATORY in docstring and prompts
- AI assistants MUST perform online research and provide URLs
- research_urls parameter optional for backward compatibility but strongly enforced
- Enhanced prompts to REJECT submissions without research URLs
- Clear instruction that online research is not optional
- URLs should be comma-separated list demonstrating actual research
- Prioritize existing solutions: current repo > well-known libraries > in-house

Key changes:
- ✅ MANDATORY online research requirement in all documentation
- ✅ Backward compatible research_urls parameter (optional with empty default)
- ✅ Enhanced validation to reject missing URLs as research failure
- ✅ Clear guidance that online research is required, not optional
- ✅ Instructs AI to actually DO research, not just ask for URLs
- ✅ All tests passing (41/41)

Fixes validation error while maintaining mandatory research requirement.

* feat: enforce mandatory online research with List[str] URLs and collaborative workflow

- Add mandatory minimum 3 URLs validation for research_urls parameter
- Change research_urls from str to List[str] for proper URL handling
- Add validation that rejects submissions with insufficient research URLs
- Update docstring to emphasize collaborative workflow with user
- Clarify that AI must 'collaborate with the user' and 'perform ONLINE research'
- Restructure workflow order: requirements → online research → repo analysis → design → plan
- Enhanced prompts to properly format URL lists with Jinja templating
- All tests updated to provide minimum 3 URLs and use List[str] format

Breaking changes:
- research_urls parameter now requires List[str] instead of str
- Minimum 3 URLs required (validates and rejects if insufficient)
- Function signature maintains backward compatibility with None default

Benefits:
- ✅ Forces actual online research with evidence (minimum 3 URLs)
- ✅ Prevents AI from working unilaterally - requires collaboration
- ✅ Proper data structure for URL handling (List[str])
- ✅ Clear workflow prioritizing existing solutions over custom development
- ✅ All tests passing with proper URL validation (41/41)
